## Description

This is an etch a sketch application that allows users to create a custom sized canvas (to a maximum size of 64x64) and select from 3 options: colourful (random colour), black (black) and darken (darkens the current colour of a square). The user is also able to reset the board to have a fresh canvas that is the default size of 16x16.

## Future Plans

Implementation of a colour picker and add functionality that allows users on touchscreen devices to drag over squares rather than tapping individual squares to colour them.

## Known Bugs

Users on touch screen devices cannot just drag/glide their fingers over squares, they have to tap each individual square to colour them in.
